# 🩺 X-ray Rheumatology - AI-Based Diagnosis System  

This project is an **AI-powered X-ray analysis system** designed to detect and classify **rheumatic conditions** using deep learning. The model is trained on **Roboflow datasets** and deployed via a **Telegram bot**, allowing users to upload X-ray images and receive real-time diagnostic predictions.  

## 🚀 Features  
- 📊 **Automated X-ray Image Analysis** using deep learning  
- 🤖 **AI-based Classification & Detection** of rheumatic conditions  
- 📡 **Deployed via Telegram Bot** for easy access  
- 🔬 **Trained on Roboflow Dataset** for improved accuracy  

## 🏗️ Tech Stack  
- **Python** (FastAPI, NumPy, OpenCV, PIL)  
- **TensorFlow / PyTorch** (for deep learning models)  
- **Roboflow** (dataset preparation & model training)  
- **Telegram Bot API** (for real-time analysis)
